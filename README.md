What it does:

LyricGenius is a website with the purpose of assisting users in their journey of memorizing songs. It asks for two user inputs: an artist's name and their song's name. If they are valid inputs, then all the lyrics to their song will appear on a new screen. 
But there's a twist! Every line of the song has one random word missing, and it is the user's job to fill in as many of the blanks as they can which will help them memorize the song's lyrics.

How we built it:

We built LyricGenius utilizing a frontend and backend structure. The frontend refers to the user interface whereas the backend refers to the actual code behind the website. Two members of our group focused on frontend, where they built the actual website (screens for taking user input and returning song lyrics) and created LyricGenius's very own logo using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The other two members focused on backend where they utilized Python, Genius's API, Flask, Ngrok, and Libraries to write code that takes out a random word in each line of the song and transfer information to and from backend.
